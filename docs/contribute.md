## 🪙 Reward System — Xcamp Credits

- **Every verified commit, model, or dataset earns credits.**  
- Credits can be staked for governance or traded once Chi-AI monetizes.  
- Transparent credit logs via the Usage Oracle ensure every contribution is visible and auditable.

## 📋 Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Use clear docstrings and type hints.  
- Follow PEP-8 for Python and AirBnB style for JS.  
- Keep commits atomic; open PRs early for review.

### Communication
- Prefer GitHub Issues and Pull Requests for feature proposals.  
- Join bi-weekly community calls for roadmap discussions.

### Governance
- Low-risk merges can be auto-approved after review.  
- High-impact modules require DAO review and voting.  
- Malicious or low-quality commits risk credit slashing.
