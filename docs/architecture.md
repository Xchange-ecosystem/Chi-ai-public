# ðŸ§© Chi-AI v2025 Architecture

## Overview

Chi-AI is a **traceable AI infrastructure** built to unite **machine reasoning, human knowledge, and economic value** under one transparent and reward-driven protocol.

It is composed of **five interoperable layers**, each representing a domain of intelligence within the emerging **Symbiotic Web 4.0**.

---

## Layer 1: Connectivity Layer

**Purpose:**  
Provide a unified API for humans, AIs, and organizations to register, query, and connect data, models, and applications.

**Key features**
- REST & GraphQL APIs with DID-based authentication  
- Real-time event streaming (Kafka)  
- gRPC support for agent communication  

**Core tech:** FastAPI Â· gRPC Â· Redis Â· Kafka Â· PostgreSQL

---

## Layer 2: Knowledge Layer (DataUnits)

**Purpose:**  
Transform datasets and models into **verifiable, ownable assets** with on-chain provenance and licensing.

**Key features**
- DataUnits as NFT-like knowledge assets  
- Provenance tracking through IPFS and Oracle  
- RDF*/SPARQL graph for semantic search  

**Core tech:** Neo4j 5.x Â· RDF* Â· Qdrant Â· IPFS Â· SPARQL 1.2

---

## Layer 3: Usage Oracle

**Purpose:**  
Act as Chi-AIâ€™s trust and telemetry system â€” logging every meaningful use of data or code, and routing rewards accordingly.

**Key features**
- Verifiable usage logging  
- Impact-based reward calculation  
- Aggregated analytics for ecosystem health  

**Core tech:** Python Â· Ray Â· TimescaleDB Â· Ocean Protocol Â· Solidity

---

## Layer 4: Governance Layer

**Purpose:**  
Provide transparent, adaptive policy control and contributor accountability through decentralized governance.

**Key features**
- DAO-inspired structure for decision logic  
- Auto-promotion for low-risk merges  
- Tokenized credit staking and slashing  

**Core tech:** Aragon SDK Â· Snapshot Â· OpenZeppelin Governor

---

## Layer 5: Marketplace Layer

**Purpose:**  
Enable the discovery, staking, and monetization of verified data, models, and AI components.

**Key features**
- Rights-aware discovery and licensing  
- Dynamic pricing based on usage metrics  
- Cross-chain interoperability with Solana/Polygon  

**Core tech:** React Â· Next.js Â· Tailwind UI Â· Solana Â· Polygon

---

## Reflexive Stack (Research Track)

The **Reflexive Stack** â€” composed of the *Belief Ledger*, *Epistemic Immune System*, and *Temporal Holarchic Meta-Learning Engine (THME)* â€” extends Chi-AI toward **Reflexive Hybrid Intelligence (RHI)**.

- **Belief Ledger:** Bayesian trust state for each knowledge node  
- **EIS:** Detects echo-chambers and injects counterfactuals  
- **THME:** Promotes useful parts into new types or schemas  

Together they form the **self-learning core** of Chi-AI v2030.
