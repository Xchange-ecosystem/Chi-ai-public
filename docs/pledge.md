# 🪶 Chi-AI Contributor Pledge (v1.0)

> *“We build intelligence that remembers it is part of life.”*

By joining the **Chi-AI Open Task Force**, I affirm the following principles:

---

### 1. Purpose over ideology
I contribute to Chi-AI with the goal of creating transparent, traceable, and regenerative intelligence —  
not for speculation, not for control, but for collective progress and the benefit of all participants in the Symbiotic Web 4.0.

---

### 2. Open and accountable collaboration
I agree that my contributions will be openly visible, traceable through the Usage Oracle,  
and credited under the Chi-AI Commons License or equivalent open license.

---

### 3. Voluntary participation
I understand that participation is voluntary and does not establish employment, partnership, or financial obligation.  
Rewards through **Xcamp Credits** are recognition of contribution — not guaranteed income or ownership.

---

### 4. Respect and integrity
I commit to treating other contributors with respect, sharing knowledge generously,  
and maintaining honesty and scientific integrity in research, code, and communication.

---

### 5. Attribution and co-creation
I grant **Chi-AI** and the **Xchange Ecosphere** the non-exclusive right to use my contributions  
within the open protocol and its public research outputs, provided my authorship is preserved and visible.

---

### 6. Right to withdraw
I may step back or discontinue contribution at any time.  
My credited work remains part of the open record and continues to receive traceable attribution through the protocol.

---

### ✍️ Digital Acknowledgment

By submitting contributions to the Chi-AI repositories  
or signing up via the Task Force form,
